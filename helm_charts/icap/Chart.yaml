description: This is a Helm chart for deploying MetaDefender ICAP Server (https://www.opswat.com/products/metadefender/icap) in a Kubernetes cluster.
long_description: |
  This chart can deploy the following depending on the provided values:
  - One or more MD ICAP Server instances 

  ## Installation
  
  ### From source
  MD ICAP Server can be installed directly from the source code, here's an example using the generic values:
  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/OPSWAT/metadefender-k8s.git metadefender
  cd metadefender/helm_charts
  helm install my_mdicapsrv ./my_mdicapsrv -f my_mdicapsrv-generic-values.yml
  ```

  ### From the latest release
  The installation can also be done using the latest release from github:
  ```console
  helm install my_my_mdicapsrv <MDICAPSRV_RELEASE_URL>.tgz -f my_mdicapsrv-generic-values.yml
  ```

  ## Operational Notes
  The entire deployment can be customized by overwriting the chart's default configuration values. Here are a few point to look out for when changing these values:
  - Sensitive values (like credentials and keys) are saved in the Kubernetes cluster as secrets and are not deleted when the chart is removed and they can be reused for future deployments
  - Credentials that are not explicitly set (passwords and the api key) and do not already exist as k8s secrets will be randomly generated, if they are set, the respective k8s secret will be updated or created if it doesn't exist
  - **The license key value is mandatory**, if it's left unset or if it's invalid, the MD ICAP Server instance will report as "unhealthy" and it will be restarted
  - The configured license should have a sufficient number of activations for all pod running MD ICAP Server, each pod counts as 1 activation. Terminating pods will also deactivate the respective MD ICAP Server instance.
