description: This is a Helm chart for deploying MetaDefender for Secure Storage (https://www.opswat.com/products/metadefender/metadefender-for-secure-storage) in a Kubernetes cluster

long_description: |
  This chart can deploy the following depending on the provided values:
  - All MDSS services in separate pods 
  - A MongoDB database instance pre-configured to be used by MDSS

  ## Installation
  
  ### From source
  MDSS can be installed directly from the source code, here's an example using generic values:
  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/OPSWAT/metadefender-k8s.git metadefender
  cd metadefender/helm_carts
  helm install my_mdss ./mdss
  ```

  ### From the GitHub helm repo
  The installation can also be done using the helm repo which is updated on each release:
  ```console
  helm repo add mdk8s https://opswat.github.io/metadefender-k8s/
  helm repo update mdk8s
  helm install my_mdss mdk8s/metadefender_for_secure_storage
  ```

  ## Operational Notes
  The entire deployment can be customized by overwriting the chart's default configuration values. Here are a few point to look out for when changing these values:
  - By default, a MongoDB database is deployed alongside the MDSS deployment
  - In a production environment it's recommended to use an external service for the database  and set `deploy_with_mdss_db` to false in order to not deploy an in-cluster database
